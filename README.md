SecurePass is a web-based tool designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords. In todayâ€™s world, where cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, creating strong, secure passwords is crucial. This tool assesses the strength of a password based on multiple criteria, such as length, complexity, character variety, and the presence of common patterns. The goal is to encourage better password practices and help users create passwords that are more resistant to common attacks.

Key Features:

Real-time Evaluation: Users can input their password and instantly receive feedback on its strength.
Strength Categories: The strength is categorized into three levels: Strong, Moderate, and Weak, with corresponding color coding to make the results easy to interpret.
Detailed Feedback: Along with the strength score, the tool provides a breakdown of various criteria (e.g., length, use of special characters, numbers, etc.) to help users understand how their password can be improved.
User-friendly Interface: The web interface is simple, intuitive, and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for interactive elements).
Backend: Python (Flask) to handle the password evaluation logic and render the results dynamically.
Additional Libraries: Jinja2 for templating, which integrates with Flask to render HTML templates.
How It Works:

Password Submission: Users input their password into a form.
Evaluation Logic: Once the password is submitted, it is analyzed against a set of predefined criteria, such as:
Length of the password.
Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
Avoidance of common words and patterns.
Results Display: Based on the analysis, the strength is calculated and categorized (Strong, Moderate, Weak).
Criteria Breakdown: A list of criteria is displayed, showing whether each one was met, helping users understand which areas need improvement.
Use Case: SecurePass is ideal for individuals, businesses, and organizations that want to ensure their passwords meet high-security standards. It helps users create stronger passwords and avoid common mistakes that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with a password manager to suggest improvements and store passwords securely.
More advanced evaluation algorithms (e.g., entropy-based scoring).
A feature to test passwords against known data breaches.
