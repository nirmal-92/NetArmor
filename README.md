This project is an implementation of a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect anomalous network activity and potential cyber threats in real-time. The system uses a combination of anomaly detection models and supervised learning algorithms to identify both known attack patterns and unknown, previously unseen attacks.

The IDS can be deployed to monitor network traffic and classify incoming events as "normal" or "suspicious." It helps cybersecurity professionals detect and mitigate threats before they can cause significant harm.
